Currently the website is bare-bones and we look to completing it as a finished project through Code Peak. We welcome your contributions in:
-  UI improvements
-  Beautifying the template
-  Adding appropriate forms and buttons

The project is inspired by [Readme-Generator](https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator) project.


We have also used the template by [Too Minimal](https://github.com/FR0ST1N/TooMinimal) as our current Portfolio Template.
